* Ignore list and reload list. If you had problems with others Ajax navigation plugins before, it may be because some javascripts are called twice or behavior strangely try to stop reloading javascript who may be in the body to not be called each time you load a page. EX: filename1.js,filename2.js The javascript reload list is for reloading javascripts who don’t seem to load well with ajax navigation.
* Special option for Masonry. Masonry plugins or themes may pose some problems, add find the ID or Class of the masonry section.
* Insert javascript or jQuery codes in the Zajax setting on ajax send. It trigger just before ajax page loading ( you can use the jQuery sign $ ) EX: $(‘#loading’).show().
* Insert javascript or jQuery codes in the Zajax setting on ajax complete. It trigger at the end of ajax page loading ( you can use the jQuery sign $ ) EX: $(‘#loading’).hide().
* Choose the color of the load cicle and bar to fit your theme style.

I created this plugin for my music website to have continuous music playing while browsing through the pages, the others solutions didn't worked very well for me.

**Zajax Pro**

One of the strong and unique advantage from using Zajax Pro is the page preloading feature on mouse hover, Some page will load on a blink of an eye. It will wait 100 millisecond on mouse hover before preloading the page to not overload your server. The page preload on mouse hover before the user click on the link, as the user click, the page may already has preloaded and the new page will appear in a fraction of a second. Some differences with others ajax pluging. Zajax work with Google analytics, it will work with all form, input, comments ect.. Preload pages on mouse hover for instant loading with the Zajax-pro version.

*Pro version feature:*

* Preload page on mouse hover to load faster when user click on the link.
* Reload multiple sections outside the main section by ID or Class. (Menu, footer, sidebar, Ads, Google Ads). by just providing the ID/CLASS with #/. as prefix.
* Google analytics support.
